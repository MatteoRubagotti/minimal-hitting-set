# Minimal Hitting Set

**NP-Complete Problem**: Given a ground set X of elements and also a grouping collection C of subsets available in X and an integer k, the task is to find the smallest subset of X, such that the smallest subset, H hits every set comprised in C. 
This implies that the intersection of H and S is null for every set S belonging to C, with size â‰¤ k.
